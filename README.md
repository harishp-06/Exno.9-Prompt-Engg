# Aim: To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation
Algorithm

1. Select AI tools that support video generation.

2. Study the features, strengths, and limitations of each tool.

3. Create simple text prompts and generate short videos.

4. Gradually refine the prompts with more details.

5. Add motion, timing, and camera movement instructions in the prompts.

6. Test different styles such as animation, cinematic, artistic, or realistic.

7. Evaluate and adjust the prompts based on output quality.

8. Generate multiple versions of the same prompt for comparison.

9. Save and compare all outputs to understand how prompt changes affect video generation.

## Procedure

### 1. Explore Video Generation Models

Study and understand AI tools used for video creation, such as:

Runway Gen-2

Synthesia

Pictory

DeepBrain
Learn what each tool can and cannot do before starting.

### 2. Create Simple Prompts

Start by creating very basic prompts to generate short videos.
Example:

“A person walking in a park.”

Generate the video and observe how the tool responds to simple instructions.

### 3. Use Detailed Prompts

Add more specific details such as color, environment, and actions.
Example:

“A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them.”

This helps generate richer, more accurate videos.

### 4. Add Timing and Motion

Add instructions like motion, transitions, or camera movements.
Example:

“A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from the beach while waves crash gently.”

This helps control the video flow.

### 5. Experiment with Video Styles

Test different styles such as:

Animated

Cinematic

Artistic

Futuristic

Realistic

Example:

“An animated futuristic city at night, with neon lights, flying cars, and busy streets.”

### 6. Refine and Improve Prompts

Check the video output and update your prompt if needed.
You may add:

Camera angles

Lighting

Speed

Scene transitions

Example refinement:

“A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on wet roads and a fast camera chase angle.”

### 7. Generate Multiple Versions

Create 2–5 versions of the same prompt by making small changes in wording.
Compare how phrasing affects:

Scene quality

Motion

Style

Smoothness

Details

### 8. Save and Compare Videos

Save all generated videos.
Compare them to understand how different prompt styles influence:

Scene structure

Visual quality

Animation accuracy

Tool behavior

This helps you learn the best prompting techniques.

Result

The experiment was completed successfully.
Different prompting techniques were applied, and the generated video outputs clearly showed how changes in prompt detail, structure, style, and motion instructions affect the final video quality.
